# Citadel Terminal
Terminal is an online games-based programming competition for university students around the globe studying software engineering and data science.

Build algorithms with your team and see real time results as you compete in a head-to-head, round-robin style tournament for the chance to win cash prizes.

It’s an opportunity to demonstrate how you thrive under pressure as you problem-solve through programming—but most importantly, how you do it as a team.
